    "Morphology is a broad set of image processing operations that process images based on shapes. In a morphological operation, each pixel in the image is adjusted based on the value of other pixels in its neighborhood. By choosing the size and shape of the neighborhood, you can construct a morphological operation that is sensitive to specific shapes in the input image. (explanation from Mathworks)\n",

    "Morphological operations are based around a *structuring element*, which is a small binary image, often of a disk or a square. The structuring element is positioned at all possible locations in the image and it is compared with the corresponding neighbourhood of pixels. Some operations test whether the element \"fits\" within the neighbourhood, while others test whether it \"hits\" or intersects the neighbourhood.\n",
