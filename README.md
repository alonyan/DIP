# DIP
Intro workshop on Digital Image Analysis with Python. Alon Oyler-Yaniv, HMS


## This workshop requires a working copy of Python3 (ideally 3.4 or later) with the below packages. If you are unable to install the packages on your own, please let me know before the class.

* numpy
* scikit-image
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebooks

The easiest way to install all of the above packages is to install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) distribution as they are all pre-installed. Make sure to choose the right distribution for your operating system.


If you prefer to set up your own python environment I recommend using a package manager like [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) to install everything.
